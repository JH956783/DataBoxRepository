	Mr. Monkey woke up at 10am this morning.  He made himself a cinnamon raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese for breakfast, 
and then took a shower.  Millard Monkey knew that this would be a special day, so he decided to wear his favorite fuzzy 
black suit.  He combed his hair, and slid his shiny brown shoes on.  He grabbed his umbrella, just in case, and left 
through the side door. As he went to step off the porch, he noticed the giant yellow banana.
